# news-objectivity-analyzer
Chrome extension that analyzes news articles for objectivity using AI
# Background
Inspired by Tom Scott's Royal Academy address "There is no algorithm for truth" made pre-GenAI
Post GenAI I revisited the theme, wondering if the "non-algorithm" that under-pins GenAI i.e. it's "emergent behaviours" might represent something that could be considered some sort of arbitor of objectivity in news articles. Objectivity being a subjective measure hinted at using GenAI to make subjective assessments.
# Goals
Overarching goal is to bring to light the increasingly subjectivity of what passes for "news". News is no longer regularly declared as different from opinions and editorials.
I recognise that this tool would easily defeated if it became a widespread method of decerning the level of objectivity in news copy but if the concept of having such a tool could create an informal market place where tools compete not for money but for the qudos of having a tool that is the most adaptive and transperent methods of highlighting subjective vs objective news content.
Used in bulk, in theory, this could provide a standardised method for assessing the objectivity of entire news platforms against each other.
